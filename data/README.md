# Data
The dataset for this project is the [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando’s article images consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each example comprises a 28×28 grayscale image and an associated label from one of 10 classes.

Due to the size of the dataset, is not included in this repository. Instead, you can run the script `../scripts/get_data.py` to download the data and place it in this folder.
